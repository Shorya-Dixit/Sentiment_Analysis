I developed and optimized a sentiment analysis model. Basically it involves understanding the emotional tone of text.I explored various sentiment analysis techniques using architectures like Simple Sequential, LSTM, CNN, and even a hybrid LSTM-CNN architecture. I also investigated the capabilities of the advanced Transformer technology through ROBERTA.  My goal was to identify the most effective model for sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset.  Through evaluation, I found that the CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved an impressive accuracy of 88%.  To demonstrate its practical application, I even deployed this model as a web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
